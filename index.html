        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        
        <p class="who-am-i">Hi! My name is Luiza and I'm just another person trying to deal with a world pandemic while being at home. For this I started making sourdough bread at home.<br><br> 
This is a register of my journey and a bit of what I learned. 
Please don't take this as a tutorial or an expert's view, <span class="bold emphasis">I'm not an expert. </span> You can check content from people that really understand about bread linked on the right. You can see bread I made <a href="#my-experience"> here.</a></p>
        
        <p class="who-am-i">That said, I have to mention the two most important things I've learned making bread:</p>
      
      <div id="list-two-most">
        <ol>
          <li><strong class="steps">The more you do it, the better results you get.</strong>
There is always room for improvement and practice will make you understand the process more and more. <br>Luckily, as long as you don't screw up to much, even a flat, boring bread will taste really good because it already is a thousand times better than a store-bought bread, for the quality of the ingredients and because you made it.</li><br>
          <li><strong class="steps">Observation is your best tool.</strong>
Once you start to understand the variables and how they affect the result of your bread, you'll use a recipe as a parameter, but you'll watch each step carelfully knowing what to expect and seeing how your dough is reacting. <br>This is a game changer.</li>

          <h2>How to make sourdough bread?</h2>
       
        
        <p>Making sourdough bread has a process, and it took me a while to understand it. Here are the main steps:</p>
        
        
            <ol>
            <li>Feed the starter to build the levain</li>
            <li>Mix ingredients or autolyse</li>
            <li>Bulk fermentation</li>
            <li>Pre-shape</li>
            <li>Final shape and proofing</li>
            <li>Bake</li>
            </ol>
      <p>In more detail:</p>

     <h4>A note on sourdough starter</h4>
        <p>I will not write a lot about sourdough starter, because I read very little about it and because I was lucky enough that my starter worked well from my first attempt, but I wouldn't know how to explain why.</p>
<p>
I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViD0zAovcWs&list=PL1dleLLvCiHMYifKCjNINEi7hW2W0EvHf"> Baker Bettie</a>'s step by step. There's a number of videos about it on youtube, just pick whatever works for you.

          <h2>My experience making sourdough bread</h2>

      <div id="first-bread">
      <h3> First bread</h3>
        
        <p>For my first bread I followed a tutorial step-by-step, and it turned out just ok. I left it in bulk fermentation for 5 hours and I think it was not enough, I think the bread was underfermented.<br>
          Also, my starter was very young - only 7 days of life - so I think this might have affected it too.</p>

      <div id="second-bread">
      <h3>Second bread</h3>
      
     <p>My second bread was better. I made it in a cold day so I assumed this would influence fermenting times, I left it in bulk fermentation for 8 hours and it grew beautifully. Maybe I could leave it a little more, but I'm not sure.</p>

      <h3>Next breads</h3>
      <p>For my next trials, I want to experiment with different flours. Also, I want to start adding some seeds and nuts in the mixture.<br><br><br></p>
